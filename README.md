A small repo to experiment with modules in JavaScript

# Background
JavaScript (on the browser) does not have a native module syntax and so most projects use IIFE techniques to mimic modules by leveraging function scope. 
Why do we need modules ? To structure code for readability, maintainibility and potential reusability.

# What are the current options?

There are many, the ones I am looking to learn about are 

1.CommonJS
2.AMD
3.ES6 Modules
